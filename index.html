               Organizations which are independent of government involvement are known as non-governmental organizations or NGOs or non-government organizations.
            NGOs are a subgroup of organizations founded by citizens, which include clubs and associations which provide services to its members and others. They
            are usually nonprofit organizations. Many NGOs are active in humanitarianism or the social sciences. Surveys indicate that NGOs have a high degree of 
            public trust, which can make them a useful proxy for the concerns of society and stakeholders.However, NGOs can also be lobby groups for corporations,
            such as the World Economic Forum. According to NGO.org,"[an NGO is] any non-profit, voluntary citizens' group which is organized on a local, national
            or internationallevel..Task-oriented and driven by people with a common interest, NGOs perform a variety of service and humanitarian functions, bring
            citizen concerns to Governments, advocate and monitor policies and encourage political participation through provision of information.
